        <p>
          Vanklas (the “Licensed Application”) is a fitness classes discovery
          platform. Section 1, General Terms, applies to all users of the
          Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <h4>1. License</h4>
        <p>
          You are granted permission to use the Licensed Application, but it is
          not sold to you. Your use is subject to the terms of this license, and
          Vanklas retains all rights not specifically given to you. You must be
          at least 18 years old to use the Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Scope of License</h4>
        <p>
          The license provided to You by Vanklas for the Licensed Application is
          a non-transferable right to use the application on any device that You
          own or control. For Apple users, this usage must also comply with the
          Usage Rules outlined in Section 9.b. of the App Store Terms and
          Conditions (referred to as the “Usage Rules”). This license restricts
          You from using the Licensed Application on devices You do not own or
          control, and prohibits distribution or making the application
          available over a network where it could be accessed by multiple
          devices simultaneously. You are not permitted to rent, lease, lend,
          sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application.
          Additionally, You may not copy (except as explicitly allowed by this
          license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer,
          disassemble, attempt to derive the source code, modify, or create
          derivative works of the Licensed Application, its updates, or any part
          thereof (except where such restrictions are prohibited by applicable
          law or permitted by the licensing terms of any open-source components
          included in the Licensed Application). Any such actions would violate
          the rights of Vanklas and its licensors and may result in legal
          consequences, including prosecution and damages. This license also
          applies to any upgrades provided by Vanklas that replace or enhance
          the original Licensed Application, unless a separate license
          accompanies the upgrade, in which case the terms of that license will
          apply.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Consent to Use of Data</h4>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that Vanklas may collect and use personal
          and technical data, along with related information. By using the
          Licensed Application, you confirm that you have read and understood
          the Vanklas{" "}
          <Link href="/privacy-policy" className="text-navy">
            Privacy Policy
          </Link>{" "}
          (which is incorporated into this agreement by reference and available
          within the Licensed Application) and consent to the collection and use
          of your data as outlined therein. If you do not accept all terms of
          this agreement, including those in the Vanklas{" "}
          <Link href="/privacy-policy" className="text-navy">
            Privacy Policy
          </Link>
          , you must not use the Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Termination</h4>
        <p>
          This license remains in effect until terminated by either you or
          Vanklas. Your rights under this license will automatically end without
          notice from Vanklas if you fail to comply with any of its terms or the
          intent of this license, or if your actions create potential legal
          risks for Vanklas. Upon termination, you must immediately stop using
          the Licensed Application and destroy all copies, whether full or
          partial, of the application.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Services – Third Party Materials</h4>
        <p>
          The Licensed Application may provide access to Vanklas and third-party
          services (referred to collectively and individually as "Services").
          Using the Licensed Application may require internet access, and you
          agree to comply with any additional terms of service that apply to
          these Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Licensed Application, You acknowledge that you may
          encounter content that could be considered offensive, indecent, or
          objectionable. This content may include explicit language or
          unintentional links to such material generated through searches or
          URLs. You agree to use the Licensed Application at Your own risk, and
          Vanklas will not be liable for any offensive, indecent, or
          objectionable content you may encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services may display, include, or provide access to content, data,
          information, applications, or materials from third parties ("Third
          Party Materials") or links to third-party websites. Vanklas is not
          responsible for evaluating or ensuring the accuracy, completeness,
          timeliness, validity, legality, decency, quality, or copyright
          compliance of such Third Party Materials or websites. Vanklas does not
          endorse or assume any liability for third-party Services, Materials,
          or websites, which are provided solely for Your convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Location data provided by the Services is intended for basic
          navigation purposes only and should not be relied upon in situations
          where precise location information is critical. Vanklas and its
          content providers do not guarantee the availability, accuracy,
          completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data displayed by
          the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that the Services contain proprietary content, information,
          and materials protected by intellectual property laws, including
          copyright. You are not permitted to use this proprietary content in
          any way except as allowed by the Licensed Application. Reproduction,
          modification, distribution, or creation of derivative works based on
          the Licensed Application is prohibited. You also agree not to use the
          Licensed Application in any unauthorized manner, including for
          harassment, abuse, stalking, threats, defamation, or infringement of
          others' rights. Vanklas is not responsible for any such misuse by you
          or for any offensive, threatening, or illegal messages or
          transmissions you may receive while using the Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vanklas does not guarantee that these Services or Materials are
          appropriate or available for use in your location. If You choose to
          access them, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
          complying with applicable laws, including local laws. Vanklas reserves
          the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any
          Services at any time without notice. Vanklas may also impose limits on
          the use of or access to certain Services without liability. In no
          event will Vanklas be liable for the removal or disabling of access to
          any Services.
        </p>
        <h4>6. No Warranty</h4>
        <p>
          You expressly acknowledge and agree that using the Licensed
          Application is entirely at your own risk. The responsibility for the
          quality, performance, accuracy, and effort required to use the
          application lies solely with you. To the fullest extent permitted by
          law, the Licensed Application and any related services (“Services”)
          are provided “as is” and “as available,” with all faults and without
          any warranties of any kind. Vanklas disclaims all warranties and
          conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not
          limited to implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory
          quality, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, quiet enjoyment,
          and non-infringement of third-party rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vanklas does not guarantee that the Licensed Application will be free
          from interference, meet your requirements, operate without
          interruption, or be error-free. Additionally, Vanklas does not warrant
          that any defects in the Licensed Application or Services will be
          corrected. No oral or written information or advice provided by
          Vanklas or its authorized representatives will create any warranty. If
          the Licensed Application or Services prove to be defective, you are
          solely responsible for all costs associated with servicing, repair, or
          correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
          warranties or limitations on statutory consumer rights, so the above
          exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Limitation of Liability</h4>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, Vanklas shall not be liable for
          personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential
          damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data,
          business interruption, or other commercial damages or losses, arising
          from or related to your use or inability to use the Licensed
          Application, regardless of the cause or legal theory (whether
          contract, tort, or otherwise). This applies even if Vanklas has been
          informed of the possibility of such damages. Please note that some
          jurisdictions do not allow limitations on liability for personal
          injury or incidental and consequential damages, so this restriction
          may not apply to you. In no event shall Vanklas’s total liability to
          you for all damages (except as required by applicable law in cases
          involving personal injury) exceed twenty Canadian dollars (CAD$20.00)
          or the equivalent in your local currency. These limitations will
          remain in effect even if the stated remedy fails to achieve its
          essential purpose.
        </p>
        <h4>8. Sharing Your Content and Information</h4>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of all content and information you post on the
          Licensed Application. For content protected by intellectual property
          rights—such as photos, videos, your profile, comments, messages, and
          events you host, attend, or share (referred to as "IP Content")—you
          grant us specific permissions, subject to your privacy settings:
        </p>
        <div>
          <h5>1. IP License</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
              royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP Content you post on
              or in connection with the Licensed Application (the "IP License").
            </li>
            <li>
              This IP License remains valid until you delete the IP Content or
              your account, unless the content has been shared with others and
              they have not deleted it.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>2. Deletion of IP Content</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you delete IP Content, it is removed in a manner similar to
              emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you acknowledge
              that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable
              period and may still be accessible to others if cached on their
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              IP Content related to bookings and attendance will remain in the
              records of instructors for legitimate business purposes, such as
              record-keeping.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>3. Privacy Settings and Access</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Public Setting: If you publish IP Content or information using the
              Public setting, you allow everyone on Vanklas to access, use, and
              associate that information with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Private Setting: If you publish IP Content or information using
              the Private setting, only you can access, use that information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>4. Privacy Policy</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You agree to comply with the terms of the{" "}

        <h4>9. User Safety and Code of Conduct</h4>

          The safety and enjoyment of our users are our top priorities. Vanklas

          You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users.
          Please note that Vanklas does not perform criminal background checks
          or screenings on its users, nor does it verify the backgrounds or
          statements of all users. Vanklas makes no guarantees regarding the
          conduct of users or their compatibility with others. However, Vanklas
          reserves the right to conduct criminal background checks or other
          screenings (such as sex offender registry searches) at any time using
          publicly available records.
        </p>
        <h4>10. Governing law and jurisdiction</h4>
        <p>
          You agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or cause of action (including
          any non-contractual obligations arising from it) that you have with
          us, which arises out of or relates to these Terms, under the laws of
          British Columbia, Canada. You also agree to submit to the personal
          jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia, Canada, for the
          purpose of litigating all such claims. If anyone brings a claim
          against us related to your actions, content, or information on the
          Licensed Application, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and
          against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including
          reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim. While Vanklas
          provides rules for user conduct, it does not control or direct users’
          actions on the Licensed Application and is not responsible for the
          content or information users transmit or share on it. Vanklas is not
          responsible for any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or
          otherwise objectionable content or information you may encounter on
          the Licensed Application. Vanklas is also not responsible for the
          conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of the Licensed
          Application.
        </p>

        <h4>11. Protecting Other People’s Rights</h4>
        <p>
          You must respect the rights of others. When using the Licensed
          Application, you agree to the following at all times: No Infringement
          or Violations: You will not post content or take any action on Vanklas
          that infringes or violates someone else’s rights or breaks the law.
          Content Removal: Vanklas reserves the right to remove any content or
          information you post if it believes such content violates these terms
          or other policies. If your content is removed for copyright
          infringement and you believe it was a mistake, you will have the
          opportunity to appeal the decision. Repeated Infringement: If you
          repeatedly infringe others’ intellectual property rights, Vanklas may
          disable your account when appropriate. Respect for Vanklas’s
          Intellectual Property: You will not use Vanklas’s copyrights,
          trademarks (including the Vanklas name and logos), or any confusingly
          similar marks, unless you have our express written permission. No
          Sensitive Information: You will not post anyone’s identification
          documents or sensitive financial information on Vanklas. Code of
          Conduct: You will adhere to the Vanklas Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <h4>12. Registration and Account Security</h4>
        <p>
          Users of the Licensed Application must provide their real names and
          accurate information. When registering and maintaining the security of
          your account, you agree to the following commitments: Accurate
          Information: You will not provide false personal information on the
          Licensed Application or create an account for anyone other than
          yourself without permission. Single Account: You will not create more
          than one personal account. Account Disabling: If we disable your
          account, you will not create another one without our permission. Age
          Restriction: You will not use the Licensed Application if you are
          under 18 years old. Prohibited Users: You will not use the Licensed
          Application if you are a convicted sex offender. Updated Information:
          You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
          Account Security: You are responsible for the security of your
          account. You will not share your password, allow others to access your
          account, or take any action that might compromise your account’s
          security. Account Transfer: You will not transfer your account to
          anyone without first obtaining our written permission. Username
          Policy: If you choose a username or similar identifier for your
          account, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it
          is appropriate (for example, if a trademark owner complains that a
          username does not closely relate to a user’s actual name).
        </p>
        <h4>13. Assignment</h4>
        <p>
          Vanklas reserves the right to assign this agreement and its rights
          under it to any party of its choosing. You do not have the right to
          assign this agreement or any rights under it unless you obtain express
          written permission from Vanklas.

          they must address them directly with the Sponsor. Vanklas is not
          responsible for resolving such claims. Legal Compliance: Vanklas is

          and regulations, including consumer protection legislation. No
          Warranty: Vanklas does not make any representations or warranties
          regarding the quality, suitability, or fitness for purpose of any

          Application and for Vanklas’s marketing and promotional activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vanklas agrees that any use of Your Marks will solely benefit and

          Vanklas. Entire Agreement: This license, along with the Vanklas Data
          Privacy Policy and Vanklas Code of Conduct (which are incorporated by
          reference), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Vanklas.
          It replaces and supersedes any prior agreements. Severability: If any
          part of this license is found to be unenforceable, the remaining terms
          will continue to be valid and effective. No Waiver: If Vanklas fails
          to enforce any part of these terms, it will not be considered a waiver
          of its rights. Amendments or Waivers: Any changes to or waivers of
          this license must be made in writing and signed by Vanklas. Compliance
          with Laws: Nothing in this license prevents Vanklas from complying

          circumstances) is found to be invalid or unenforceable, a court may
          modify the provision to the extent necessary to achieve its original
          intent in a manner consistent with applicable law. The remaining
          provisions of these Terms (or the application of the provision in
          other circumstances) will remain fully valid and enforceable.

        </h3>
        <h4>1. Professional Service Providers</h4>
        <p>
          When you book, pay for, or otherwise interact with an instructor or
          other professional service provider on the Licensed Application, your
          contractual relationship is solely with the Professional Service
          Provider, not with Vanklas.
        </p>
        <h4>2. No Warranty for Professional Service Providers</h4>
        <p>
          While we request service providers using the Licensed Application to
          provide documentation regarding their qualifications and education to
          confirm their ability to offer the services they list, Vanklas does
          not independently verify these credentials. You acknowledge and agree
          that it is your responsibility to conduct any necessary due diligence
          on a service provider before engaging their services. Vanklas makes no
          warranties or representations regarding the quality, safety,
          credentials, reliability, suitability, reputation, or any other aspect
          of a service provider’s business.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Professional Service Provider Information</h4>
        <p>
          All business information displayed on the Licensed Application is
          provided directly by the Professional Service Provider. Vanklas cannot
          guarantee the accuracy of this information and accepts no liability
          for any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the business information
          provided.
        </p>

          for any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the business information
          provided.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Booking and Payment</h4>
        <p>
          When booking, purchasing, or otherwise interacting with a Professional
          Service Provider, you acknowledge and agree that your contractual
          relationship is solely with the Professional Service Provider, not
          Vanklas. You also acknowledge and agree: Terms and Conditions: You
          will be subject to the Professional Service Provider’s terms and
          conditions, even if those terms are not accessible through the
          Licensed Application. It is your responsibility to review and
          understand these terms. Disputes and Complaints: If you are
          dissatisfied or have a dispute related to a booking, purchase, or
          interaction, you must direct your complaint or dispute to the
          Professional Service Provider, not Vanklas. Hold Harmless: You agree
          to hold Vanklas harmless in the event of any dispute arising from the
          delivery of services by the Professional Service Provider. Good Faith:
          When booking or interacting with a Professional Service Provider, you
          agree to act in good faith and comply with any terms and conditions
          communicated to you by the service provider. Specifically, when
          booking services through the Licensed Application, you do so with the
          genuine intention of using those services.
        </p>
        <h4>6. Cancellation and refunds</h4>
        <p>
          When booking or reserving a spot for an event through the Licensed
          Application, you are entering into a contract directly with the
          service provider, not Vanklas. Your booking is subject to the
          cancellation policy, terms, and conditions set by the service
          provider. The service provider is solely responsible for establishing
          their refund policy. If you are unsure about the cancellation terms,
          you should clarify them with the service provider before completing
          your booking or reservation. If a refund is applicable under the
          service provider’s cancellation policy, it must be processed by the
          service provider through their Stripe account. You acknowledge and
          agree that Vanklas has no responsibility or liability for any refunds
          owed and cannot compel a refund or take any action related to refunds.
          All payments are processed through the service provider’s payment
          system, not Vanklas.
        </p>
        <h4>7. Cancellation and refunds</h4>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Vanklas harmless from and
          against any claims, actions, or demands, including reasonable legal
          and professional fees, arising from or related to: Your breach of
          these Terms, Your use, misuse, or illegal use of the Licensed
          Application. Vanklas will notify you of any such claim, suit, or
          proceeding. Vanklas reserves the right to take exclusive control of
          the defense and handling of any matter subject to indemnification
          under this section. In such cases, you agree to cooperate fully with
          any reasonable requests to assist Vanklas in defending the matter.

          legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that
          entity and its affiliates to these Terms. In such cases, the terms
          “You,” “Your,” or related capitalized terms will refer to the entity
          and its affiliates. If you do not have this authority, or if you do
          not agree to these Terms, you must not accept them and are not
          permitted to use the Licensed Application.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Eligibility and warranty</h4>

          You acknowledge that the Licensed Application may experience
          interruptions. While we make reasonable efforts to keep the Licensed
          Application accessible, it or any of its components may become
          unavailable at times for various reasons, including routine
          maintenance. You understand and agree that access to the Licensed
          Application may be interrupted, suspended, or terminated due to
          circumstances both within and outside of our control. Additionally,
          interruptions in third-party platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter,
          etc.) may impact your use of the Licensed Application, and these
          issues are beyond our ability to prevent or resolve. Interruptions
          beyond our control do not entitle you to terminate your subscription
          or demand a full or partial refund of any prepaid fees.

        <h4>4. Booking and payment</h4>
        <p>
          When booking, reserving, purchasing, or otherwise interacting with a
          Consumer, you acknowledge and agree that your contractual relationship
          is solely with the Consumer, not Vanklas. You also acknowledge and
          agree: No Guarantee of Attendance or Payment: Vanklas cannot guarantee
          that a Consumer will attend or pay for a booked session. Vanklas has
          no liability to you for a Consumer’s non-payment or non-attendance.
          Terms and Conditions: It is your responsibility to provide the
          Consumer with valid terms, conditions, and cancellation policies.
          Disputes and Complaints: If a booking, purchase, or interaction leads
          to dissatisfaction or a dispute, the Consumer must direct their
          complaint or dispute to you, not Vanklas. You agree to hold Vanklas
          harmless in the event of any dispute arising from the delivery of your
          services, even if a Consumer directs a claim at Vanklas. Good Faith
          and Compliance: When booking or interacting with a Consumer, you agree
          to act in good faith and comply with all applicable regulations, laws,
          and best practices.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Cancellation and refunds</h4>
        <p>
          When booking an event through the Licensed Application, you are
          entering into a contract directly with the service provider, not
          Vanklas. Your booking is subject to the cancellation policy, terms,
          and conditions set by the service provider. The service provider is
          solely responsible for establishing their refund policy. If you are
          unsure about the cancellation terms, you should clarify them with the
          service provider before completing your booking. If a refund is
          applicable under the service provider’s cancellation policy, it must
          be processed by the service provider through their payment account.
          You acknowledge and agree that Vanklas has no responsibility or
          liability for any refunds owed and cannot compel a refund or take any
          action related to refunds. All payments are processed through the

          discretion.

          will not be entitled to a refund, even if the cancellation occurs
          before being charged. Account Transfer and Access: You agree not to
          sell, trade, or transfer your login or account to another party.
          Unless explicitly agreed to in writing by Vanklas, you will not charge
          anyone for access to any portion of the Licensed Application or its
          content. You are responsible for all actions taken through your

          fault of your own. Code of Conduct: You agree to abide by the Vanklas
          Code of Conduct at all times.

          before suspending or terminating your account. However, any suspected
          fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may result in immediate
          termination of your account and may be reported to law enforcement
          authorities. No Liability: Vanklas shall not be liable to you or any
          third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of
